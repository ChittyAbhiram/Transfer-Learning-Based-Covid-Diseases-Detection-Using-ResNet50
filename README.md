# Transfer-Learning-Based-Covid-Diseases-Detection-Using-ResNet50


The Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, a worldwide health pandemic caused by (SARS) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and SARs-CoV-2, has had an enormous global impact. COVID-19 is the third viral infectious illness induced by SARS-CoV-2 in the twenty-first century, following Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). COVID-19 has killed over 300,000 individuals in practically every country on every continent. CT results, in conjunction with the RT-PCR test, are useful in determining the severity of the illness. In this project, we will train a ResNet50 model to categorize CT images as covid or non-covid. This model can accomplish early diagnosis and a low mortality rate.
